# BG's NeuralNet

A simple implementation of an Artificial Neural Network from the ground-up, in C++

## Artificial Neural Networks: A crash-course

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a machine learning model inspired by the biological neurons in our brains.

At its most basic, an ANN has:

-   Perceptrons (neurons/nodes): The fundamental 'unit' of an ANN. A perceptron receives inputs and applies specified functions in order to product an output
-   Connections (edges/links): Connections link together perceptrons. Since ANNs are a graph-based model, these are the edges of a graph
-   Input layers:
